# Credit-Card-Checker
**Credit card verification process, using my knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time.**

As part of my project I was given a list of various arrays of valid, invalid & 'mystery' credit card numbers. 

Using this list I had to create:

    1. create a function to validate each of the credit cards, ==returning either 'True' if valid or 'False' if invalid==.
    2. create a function to check through nested array of credit card numbers and ==return array of invalid credit card numbers==.
    3. create a function to ==identify the credit card companies== that have issued the faulty numbers.

After 2 attempts I finally got the first task function to work and then worked through the rest ensuring that i was logging regularly to test out my code was working the way that I needed.
